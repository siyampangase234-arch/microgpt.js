The most atomic way to train and inference a GPT in pure, dependency-free JavaScript.
This repository covers the complete algorithm.

Adapted from Karpathy's [microgpt.py](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/8627fe009c40f57531cb18360106ce95). This implementation matches the original exactly, but now can run in JavaScript environments, including browsers and Node.js.
