## 🔍 What is microgpt.js?

microgpt.js is a small and straightforward software tool to train and run a GPT model using only plain JavaScript. It does not require any extra software or complex setups. This means you can use it directly in your browser or on your computer without needing to install anything else.

The main goal of microgpt.js is to show how GPT works from the ground up. It uses simple code so you can learn the basic steps behind training and producing text with GPT. It is inspired by Karpathy’s microgpt.py but made to work purely with JavaScript.

## 📝 How to Use microgpt.js

Once the application is open in your browser, here is how to use it:

### Training Your GPT Model

1. **Prepare your text data:** Write or gather plain text you want the model to learn from. For beginners, try with simple sentences about a topic you like.

2. **Load the data:** Use the interface to paste or upload your text.

3. **Start training:** Click the “Train” button. The model will process the text step-by-step.

4. **Training progress:** You will see progress updates in the browser. Training may take a few minutes based on your data size and computer speed.

### Generating Text (Inference)

After training:

1. Enter a starting word or phrase in the “Prompt” box.

2. Click “Generate” to create new text. The model uses what it learned to predict and write more text.

3. Experiment with different prompts and see how the output changes.

## 🔧 Settings & Options

microgpt.js provides some basic settings for you to customize:

- **Training speed:** Choose how fast the model learns. Faster speed uses more CPU but finishes quicker.

- **Text length:** Set how many words you want to generate during inference.

- **Model size:** Adjust parameters to make the model simpler or more complex. Larger models need more memory.

- **Reset model:** Clear the trained model and start over with new data.

All settings can be changed from the user interface without coding.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips

- **The app does not open:** Make sure you open the HTML file in a supported browser like Chrome or Firefox.

- **No training progress:** Check that your text data is not empty and try a smaller sample.

- **Very slow training:** Close other programs to free memory or reduce training speed.

- **Errors in browser:** Refresh the page and reopen the HTML file.

If problems continue, check the Issues section on the GitHub repository for common questions and fixes.
